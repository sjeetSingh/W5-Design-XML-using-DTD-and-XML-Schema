# XML Design using DTD and XML Schema

Project Description :
 Based on this ER diagram, do the following:

    Create a DTD that captures all this information. Avoid data redundancies (do not duplicate data, except
    keyrefs/idrefs). You may use IDs/IDrefs in DTD. You may introduce your own ids (ID/IDRefs can hold alphanumerical
    values only).
    Create a small XML document that matches your DTD.
    Validate your XML document against your DTD.
    Create an XML Schema that matches your XML document. You must define all keys/keyrefs.
    Validate your XML document against your XML Schema.
